# Contact

I will generally return your call within 24 hours. If you have not heard from me within 24 hours, please call back, as messages at times do not come through clearly and I may not have gotten your information, especially if you are using a cell phone. If you are hesitant about contacting me and prefer I contact you, please email me and I will get back to you promptly. I am usually able to respond within 24 hours during the week and within 48 hours if you contact me on a weekend.
