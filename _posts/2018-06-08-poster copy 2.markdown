### Objective

This is an exercise in 10 steps: transform a word or a letterform into an entirely new idea.

### Background

When you open a book, you see two pages side-by-side. A book forms a rhythm of twos. When you look at the very beginning of a book, your eye probably settles on the right hand page. It then moves back and forth across the spread. This dynamic must be kept in mind as you invent the ten-step transformation.

As the letter undergoes its metamorphosis, it can twist, stretch, change scale, shape and position from spread to spread. The images should appear different in each stage but when view as a whole have unity and rhythm. The steps must be even. You may get to step 6 and realize you have to start over to avoid unevenness or tedium.

- **Research**: Research different topics and processes that interest you. Those should be interesting enough to be turned into a step-by-step process. The process should demonstrate a clear change in the letterforms. Identify 3 keywords to describe your idea.

- **Thumbnails**: Come up with a minimum of 10 thumbnails with various ideas. It would help to have the steps in each one sketch or flesh out.

- **Rough Comps**: Take one of the ideas and make refinements to it. The refinements should include a more descriptive flush outlook of the letterform transofmration and the feel of each steps.

- **Final Comp**: Keep refining the comp. Create a dummy with the transformation steps and physical layout of the project. Also incorporate color or any other elements you wish to include in your final.
