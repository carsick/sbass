# Relationships

Opening yourself up to another person and developing true intimacy can be the most enriching experience imaginable. But so much can get in the way. Continually choosing the wrong partners, anxieties about getting close to the right ones, and being haunted by past relationship failures can scuttle your ability to make a satisfying and sustained connection.

Psychotherapy can allow you to see your relationship patterns more clearly and help you to understand what drives you to repeat the same mistakes over and over again. It can also enhance your ability to communicate with partners, family members and friends so you can develop greater closeness and connection.
