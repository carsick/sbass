# Divorce

Divorce can leave you shattered. Even if you saw it coming, you can feel like someone took a hammer to your life. No one around you comprehends how out of control you feel. Mining this distressing experience to understand what went wrong can be painstaking and difficult, but insights gained about yourself and your relationship patterns can help you avoid repeating mistakes and lead to greater satisfaction in the future. A supportive ally can help you navigate this difficult transition and assist you to transform your heartache into wisdom. What may start out as an excruciating loss often becomes a voyage of self discovery.
