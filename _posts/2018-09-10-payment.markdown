# Payment

Therapy is an intimate conversation, and you need to feel comfortable with the person you work with. The best way to know whether I am the right therapist for you is for us to talk.

I offer an initial phone consultation free of charge to allow us to assess whether we are a good fit. During this conversation, I will ask questions to see whether I believe I can be helpful to you, and you will get a sense of how it feels to talk with me. At that time, you can inquire about my current fee. If you cannot afford my full fee, please tell me so we can discuss your options; I may be able to accommodate you, or provide an appropriate referral. I do have a limited number of sliding scale sessions available during the day for people who cannot afford a full fee, such as students and younger clients. I prefer payment at each session, but can arrange to bill at the end of the month. If you are using insurance, I can provide you with a monthly statement upon request so you can submit it for reimbursement.
