# Creativity & its discontents

A creative slump is agony for a writer, artist or musician. When ideas won't hatch and you can't incubate any inspiration, your mind can feel like a caged bird. Psychotherapy can be an effective way to free your creativity from captivity and dry off those wet wings. Emotional blocks and un-thought meanings about creative work can block your flow and inhibit your ability to generate new and interesting ideas. Understanding and working through whatever is keeping you stuck can allow your creative process to take flight again.
