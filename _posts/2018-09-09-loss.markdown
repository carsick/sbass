# Loss

Are you having a hard time moving beyond a loss? You may have felt stuck for some time, unable to move forward, and fearful that you are wearing out your welcome with loved ones who just wish you would get over it. Here, your loss can be talked about for as long as it takes to let go. When you process a loss as deeply as you need, you will find it easier to move on. Let me provide a safe place where you can come back to life again.
