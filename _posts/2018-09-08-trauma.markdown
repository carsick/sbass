# Trauma

Steve Jobs said it: "Sometimes life is going to hit you in the head with a brick." Traumatic experience destroys the world as you knew it. It cracks you open and loosens familiar ways of thinking and feeling about yourself and your life. Alongside overwhelming emotions, unanswered questions and raw pain lies the opportunity to discover new competencies and strengths within. Some things are too devastating to face alone, and an empathic presence can ease the anguish of talking about experiences that feel unthinkable and unspeakable. Therapy can help you become more adept at sorting through and coming to terms with the often confusing and conflicting thoughts and feelings left behind in the wake of a trauma.
