# How I work

People come to see me when they want to make meaningful changes that will lead them to having more of what they want in life: more loving relationships, more work satisfaction, more insight into themselves, more creative fulfillment, more joy. I believe that people grow in relationships, and that two minds working together on complex problems is the best way to uncover their core and create the conditions for change.

My style is engaged, respectful, collaboritive and compassionate. I am interested in grasping the whole of your world, inner and outer, and how they interact. I find that the best way to make sense of your current feelings is to understand them in the context of your life, past and present, and I will listen carefully and work with you to develop a fuller understanding of what you are struggling with and how I can support you in moving through it. I have often found that what starts as an effort to overcome pain can become a "portal of discovery" to new ways of being, seeing, and living a fuller and more fulfilled life.
