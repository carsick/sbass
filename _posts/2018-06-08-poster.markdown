### Objective

Research a subject that you are interested in and create a 11" x 17" poster to explain and summarize your presentation.

### Background

Learning how to organize information with a strong hierarchal sense will help you develop stronger communication skills essential throughout your career as a designer and artist who need to present their work well.

**Criteria**:
1. Clarity of message
2. Interesting subject matter
3. Well designed presentation showing a hierarchy of information

Your presentation should have several levels of info and the hierarchy should be visible to the viewer:

Element | Information
--- | ---
Title | Main heading, subject of information graphic
Subtitle | Secondary explanation or specific definition under the main topic
Body Copy | More detailed information describing the project or presentation. May include dates/times/contact information. For those interested parties, more targeted information to further explain topic.
Graphics | Supporting explanatory abstract or photographic visual materials related to the concept or actual products
Negative Space | Be mindful of white/negative space so information isn't cluttered. Use background to call attention to various points or have it create its own imagery ([figure–ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Figure%E2%80%93ground_(perception)))
Sign off | Signature or logo + copyright information or contact information
